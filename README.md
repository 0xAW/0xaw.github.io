Hi, I'm Alex.
I'm a developer and hacker here in Christchurch. 
I've held a lot of different roles over the years:

```json
{
  "roles": [
    "director of offensive security.",
    "security researcher.",
    "principal developer.",
    "development lead.",
    "contract developer.",
    "bug bounty hunter.",
    "pentester"
  ]
}
```

You name it, If there is code and computation to be made or broken, I've done it.
I get a few questions about my development workflow. Hacking process, etc. So I
thought I would publicly list some snippets and GIFs showing some of those things.

- [My Development Environment](code.html)
- [Some code Examples](snippets.html)
- [A little about me](about.html)

Thanks for reading.
